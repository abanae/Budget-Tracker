## Testing:
- Express.js - Used for application set up of middle ware for end point connection between the front end and backend.
- Node.js - Used for package managment and to execute JavaScript code to build command line tool for server-side scripting.
- Mongoose - MongoDB object modeling tool designed to work in an asynchronous environment. Mongoose supports both promises and callbacks.
- Morgan - HTTP request logger middleware for node.js.
- compression - Express decreases the downloadable amount of data that's served to users. Through the use of this compression, we can improve the performance of our Node. js applications as our payload size is reduced drastically.
- lite-server -  only node server that serves a web app, opens it in the browser, refreshes when html or javascript change, injects CSS changes using sockets, and has a fallback page when a route is not found
- Javascript - Used to base functionality of functions and prompts within the application.
- Postman is a collaboration platform for API development. Postman's features simplify each step of building an API and streamline. 
- Robo 3T - (formerly Robomongo) is the free, lightweight, open-source MongoDB GUI with an embedded mongo shell, real auto-completion, and support for MongoDB.
- GitHub - Hosts repository that can be deployed to GitHub Pages. 
- Heroku: Cloud Application Platform.
